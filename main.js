/* Weather-Project Eval
Part 1:
- A user should be able to enter a city into the url, click "Search" and get weather data on the city they entered.
- A user should be able to see the current temperature (in imperial units).
- A user should be able to see the current conditions (whether it's cloudy, raining, etc).
- When a user does another search, their first search should be replaced.

Part 2:
- When a user searches, they should additionally see a 5-day forecast, and each of the five days should have an associated day of the week, weather condition and temperature.
